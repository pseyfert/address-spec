# Address Specification

License: [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)

Address notation and describing places is weird. And different from country to country or even depending on regions. But we need to understand them in order to be able to create better geocoding.

The goal of this repository is to create definitions for usual address notation.

The files are not meant to be machine readable, but should rather serve as a compendium for software creators.

File Names should follow the ISO 3316-alpha 2 standard, the contents should be in English. If you think translations would be useful, please contact me.
